  <h1>Mapping Storm Event: NOAA Dataset Visualization</h1>
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>

  <p>This project is dedicated to exploring and visualizing storm events across the United States using the Storm Events Database, an official publication of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The dataset documents occurrences of storms and significant weather phenomena with sufficient intensity to cause loss of life, injuries, significant property damage, and disruption to commerce. The data spans from 1950 to 2023 and is organized into gzipped CSV files for each year.</p>

  <h2>Technologies Used</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Python Notebook:</strong> Leveraged to conduct in-depth analysis on the dataset.</li>
    <li><strong>Visualization Libraries:</strong> Utilized various visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Vega-Lite, Plotly, and Bqplot to create insightful visualizations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Analysis and Findings</h2>

  <p>The Python notebook included in this repository provides a detailed analysis of the NOAA Storm Events Database. The findings include trends, patterns, and insights derived from the dataset. To explore the visualizations, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/surbhi-bhor/MappingStormEventNOAA-dataset-visualization/blob/main/Mapping%20Storm%20event_%20NOAA%20Dataset%20Report.pdf">Mapping Storm Event: NOAA Dataset Report.pdf</a> document.</p>

  <h3>Dynamic Dataset Observatory</h3>

  <p>This observatory produces a dynamic dataset that updates with current data. Beautiful Soup is employed to scrape and parse the latest information, ensuring that the dataset remains relevant and up-to-date.</p>

  <h3>How to Use</h3>

  <p>To reproduce the analysis or explore the visualizations locally, download the Python notebook from the repository and run it in your preferred environment. The notebook provides step-by-step insights into the dataset and the code used for analysis.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>In conclusion, this project enhances our understanding of storm events in the United States over several decades. The visualizations and analysis not only shed light on historical trends but also provide a dynamic perspective by updating the dataset with the latest information. The insights gained from this project contribute to a better comprehension of the impact of storm events and aid in future preparedness and mitigation efforts.</p>
